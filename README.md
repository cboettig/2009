Though my open lab notebook started in 2010, a handful of previously private notes on earlier and on-going projects dating back to 2008 were later added as notebook entries. In 2015 the single continuous notebook (http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html), now written in Jekyll format, was broken out into separate repositories by year. The 2009 jekyll sources (Github master branch) are now permanently archived on figshare at the DOI above. HTML versions are found on the gh-pages branch. These entries are best viewed at http://carlboettiger.info/2009
